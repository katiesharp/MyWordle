# [MyWordle](https://katiesharp.github.io/MyWordle/)

A simple, interactive Wordle clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike the NYTimes Wordle, you can play as many times as you want in one day.

## Features

- **Unlimited Plays** – No daily limit, play as many times as you like.
- **Dynamic Letter Feedback** – Letters change color to indicate correctness:
  - Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
  - Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
  - Gray: Incorrect letter.
- **Randomized Word Selection** – Each game picks a word at random from a preset list.
- **On-Screen Keyboard** – Clickable keyboard for easy letter entry.
- **Simple & Responsive Design** – Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## How to Play

1. Guess a 5-letter word by typing or clicking the on-screen keyboard.
2. Press "Enter" to submit your guess.
3. Use the color clues to refine your next guess.
4. You have six tries to guess the correct word.
5. If you guess correctly, you'll see a congratulatory message. If not, the answer will be revealed.
